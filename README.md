## 🌿 The Vision
**TomaTimer** was built for those who find traditional timer apps too cluttered. It is a distraction-free space designed to help you enter "flow state" and stay there. No ads, no tracking, just focus.

## ✨ Key Features
- ☁️ **Aesthetic Interface:** Clean typography and a calming color palette.
- ⏱️ **Dual Modes:** Seamlessly switch between a high-precision **Stopwatch** and a classic **Pomodoro Timer**.
- 📓 **Session History:** Automatically logs your completed sessions so you can track your daily productivity trends.
- 🚫 **Pure Experience:** Zero ads, zero subscriptions, and fully open source.
- 🌙 **Night Owl Friendly:** Beautifully optimized Dark Mode.
Here is the raw Markdown code for your TomaTimer README. I’ve included aesthetic badges, clear sections, and a minimalist layout that fits the "clean and ad-free" vibe of your project.

You can copy and paste this directly into your README.md file on GitHub.
